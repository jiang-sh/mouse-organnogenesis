# mouse-organnogenesis
We performed single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq in E7.5 mouse embryos and 16 representative organs at the E13.5 stage. 
The organs included the nervous system (forebrain, mild brain, hindbrain, spinal cord, and eye), respiratory system (lung), digestive system (spleen, pancreas, liver, stomach, intestine), urinary system (kidney), hormonal system (female gonad, male gonad) and locomotor system (forelimb and heart).
